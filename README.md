# EXCEL-PROJECT
## LET ME TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT THIS PROJECT
#### I had goosebumps all over my body, i started thinking how do i complete this project without failing, but as someone who is determined, i didnt let fear get the better part of me.
#### so I did this excel project (case study Amazon) to the best of my knowledge.
#### I honestly do not know if I would pass it, but I am happy I gave it a trial
#### Here is the link for th project, crititisim is welcome [excel project report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JaHcsy6_0Rv7BA10_jJICpYirjwdOx1z/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108057974644952937616&rtpof=true&sd=true)
# HOW I ACHIEVED MY RESULTS ON THIS PROJECT
#### First I cleaned my data by checking for duplicates by highlighting the entire data and using my data task bar to check for duplicates.
#### Then I proceeded to splitting the columns of the category because its a multi level category all in one category.
#### To do this I copied the category and pasted on another sheet , i then proceeded to highlighting the sheet, then to my text to columns button and used delimeter to split the columns.
#### Thereafter I renamed each categories and pasted them back in the main data , i deleted the main category(mother category ) becasue I had already done some splitting.
#### after this step i filtered my data and checkef for errors in all colums and made some corrections. 
#### I wanted to split the product name but it kept on giving wrong splitting, so i left it with the way it is long. Maybe after this project i will go back to it and give it another trail.
#### After all these steps I changed my sheet to table by using Clt + T and proceeded to summarize my data in my Pivot table.
#### This was how i achieved my result.
